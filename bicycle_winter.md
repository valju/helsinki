# What cycling in wintertime in Finland means

While cycling you usually produce a lot of heat. Winter time the biggest problems would then be cold airflow on face, fingers, toes, or through clotehs. Or getting wet in slushy rain.

* **Rain jacket or other windstopper** is needed. Probably a bit loose so you can put warm breathing layers under.

* **Winter shoes** and wool socks!

* **Winter tires** for bicycles make winter cycling safer and pleasent/relaxed. I use "Suomi Tyres" winter tires that have ~250 spikes, studs. 5-7 studs touching the ground at each time! Other good brands exist too. That is actually old "Nokian tyres" factory, which was "Nokia tyres" earlier. I think I paid about 110 euros for a pair of 28" winter tires. 

But cheaper ones exist, and in general buying any winter stuff in Feb/March/April might give your really low prices. Usually in Helsinki the winter clothes sales e.g. start when the ski holidays happen in February. Either at start or end of that week.

* **Lamps** are important. Good steady white light for front of the bike, good steady red light to the rear. Possibly also a headlamp for the cyclist. Make sure headlamp is pointed downwards and not to other's eyes.
