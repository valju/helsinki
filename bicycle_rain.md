# What cycling in rain means

While cycling you usually produce a lot of heat, so the only problem is mostly getting wet.

* Cycling home during rain usually is not a problem. I might leave rain cycling clothes home if I get to destination without rain. Returning home to warm shower and cloth drying racks is not a problem even if getting wet

* **Rain jacket** that is long enough from back, but is still breathing would be nice. Though sometimes not very cheap.

* **Rain trousers** I usually wear if raining and long day in destination awaits.

* **Rain helmet** is something that stops the rain, and protects the eyes as well with some lid or roofing.

* **Rain gloves** to protect hands. Possibly mitten kind of and with the space inside for some warm layers.

Sometimes I have gone to events with dry change clothes in watertight bag, and with a netbag for moist old clothes. Works too!
