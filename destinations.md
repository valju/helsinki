# Just fast list of destinations one could visit by bicycle

On your own and we could also organize common ones too. More ideas and info possibly added later

* Helsinki 1952 locations around. There are a lot of related sites. There is "Helsingin Olympialaiset 1952. Tapahtumat kartalla" or so named map in some bookstores. I have two copies.

* Museokortti.fi Museum card museum. Pay some 74 euros a year and you can visit over 300 museums in Finland, many of them in Helsinki area.

* Historic sites like e.g. the Helsinki air defence installations 1939-1944. Like e.g. batteries at several hills. Best restored one at Taivaskallio hill. Usually on nice hilly and parklike places.

* Previous one could be accompanied with: 

1. Tuusula antiaircraft museum
1. a 30min documentary film 
1. a booklet called "Helsingin ilmatorjunnan taistelupaikat 
1. Airshelter museum at Kruunuhaka next to Hakaniemi
