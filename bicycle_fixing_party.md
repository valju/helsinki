# Bicycle fixing support and tools could be offered

I or others could bring tools to e.g. Pasila garage or Tripla garage and have bicycle fixing fest there.

There are some specific tools needed for e.g. placing tight tyres on the rims, or balancing the rims and tightening the wheel spikes.
Or for cutting the chains and putting them back together.

It doesn't make sense everybody buys all the tools.

To have a bike fixed by professionals costs 80-150 euros in shops. Depending on what needs to be done.
