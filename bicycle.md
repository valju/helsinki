# Thoughts and opinions about bicycle and cycling in Helsinki

* Because of the 2022 attack against Ukrainians showing the Sochi bunker rat a middle finger by cutting the fuel consumption starts to a fascinating idea.

* Most of us also could benefit of losing some weight (less injuries, more energy, better concentration and cognitive skills, more normal hormone activity)

* Cycling is good for blood circulation too. Blood circulates also via brain! Even if as a sole sport not good for the back, so other sports need to be added.

## You can cycle all around the year in Helsinki
### Here are my basic bicycle opinions - But you are fine buying any that does not follow my opinions too

**'Disclaimer 1:'**  Electrically assisted **e-bikes** are now in. They always pass me in uphill like I would not even be moving... But they also cost a lot and maintenance requires professionals.

**'Disclaimer 2:'** Before e-bikes the so called **fat bikes** were popular. Fat big tire that makes it easy to ride in the terrain. And seems you can also use it on snow or slush winter time. But again a bit more expensive, and I have no expertice on them.

**'Disclaimer 3:'** In traditional bikes, many people like the 18-21-27-speed bicycles that have e.g. 3 sprockets=chainwheels in front and 6-9 sprockets at the back. They are extremely light on gear 1 and overall resistance/powerloss caused by the gears and axels is minimal.

* But I like mostly the inside-the-back-hub gears. E.g. Shimano Nexus 7 or 8 speed. If you are lucky, you can ride same bike 15 years without any maintenance inside the gear hub. E.g. I have used such bicycles 7-15 years without gear maintenance. (I have also one 3-gear bike that is 40-year-old and still running, but 3-gear is good for reserve bike only)

* This kind of closed gears model is the heaviest to pedal. But they are relatively cheap and carefree, and training is just a plus. 

* I would definitely go for 28" or 29" wheel bikes for the remarkably smaller rolling resistance. Even if you would be the smallest woman. Usually saddle and handlebar can be lowered enough.

* Make sure your feet hit the ground properly simultaneously

* I would only buy inner tubes with the car=auto=Shrader air valves. You can carefull fill in air at gas station too.

* You want later all of your tubes of all the bikes be with same valve! Helps in bringing just one small air pump with you.

* (You can make back-hub gears lighter by replacing the 16-17 teeth single back sprocket with one with 24-25 teeth. Divide the first number by the second to get the final pedaling force needed, e.g. 17/24 would give just 71% power of original needed, makes rather big difference. 

Actuallt possibly the lightening effect is even greater. As the 17-teeth original sprocket makes the chain twist tight, where as 24-teeth sprocket is bigger and chain runs around it smoother.)
