# Cycling security

Some fast advice on security

* **See well** with your front lamp and possible headlamp.

* **Be seen well** with your lights, especially the steady non-blinkin red light at back. 

(Blinking lights are actually illegal for bicycles in Finland, though not fined. But blinking is not nice towards other people in the traffic. Cyclists are not some kind of special thing in traffic)

* **Bright color clothes and reflectors** make you visible. Don't be that guy I saw one day. Black bike, black shoes, black helmet, black clothes, black backbag. I also use black things, as they combine with everything, and don't show all dirt, true. But have something bright too. Like red or orange or yellow or brigth blue jacket & visible helmet.

Test: You want to be seen from the corner of the eye of the car drivers too. And from the small mirrors.

* **Move so that nobody CAN hit you.** Yes, that is my advice to cyclist. Ride so that not only is it possible for car drivers to avoid you (if they are not drunk or tired or texting), but ride so that they cannot hit you (if the are drunk or tired or texting or road raging)

* **Show clearly and slowly your handsigns.** Especially show long before you turn where you gonna turn and until you have moved. If you are going straight over some crossing then point straight over towards your target.

* **Get a feel of your bike and its breaks.** Test the breaks for real where you can safely do it. Practice full panic breaking. Because need for that **will** occur.
How does breaking work in loose sand? Make sure to brake mostly with the back breaks. Some bicycles have pedal brake, then learn to use **mainly the pedal brake**. Otherwise a guaranteed accident is waiting!

* **Go around the forest path corners thinking that there are two bikes** around the blind corner. Just some time ago there were **three** side by side as people were passing a couple! So adjust your speeds around corners and crossroads. Things happen! And what if there is loose sand at the same point?
